Supporting data:
- 2024 UAE Rental Market Report (our proprietary research)
- Survey of 100+ UAE rental operators

## 🚫 What to AVOID (Black/Gray Hat Tactics)

**Never Do**:
- ❌ Buy links (Google penalty risk)
- ❌ Use PBNs (Private Blog Networks) - artificial link schemes
- ❌ Excessive link exchanges (unnatural pattern)
- ❌ Comment spam on blogs (nofollow anyway, damages reputation)
- ❌ Forum profile links at scale (low value, spam risk)
- ❌ Article spinning / low-quality guest posts
- ❌ Link farms or link directories (no value, potential penalty)
- ❌ Automated outreach blasts (low success, reputation damage)

**Why White-Hat Only**:
- Google penalties can devastate domain authority
- Quality > Quantity (10 DA60 links > 100 DA10 links)
- Sustainable long-term (no risk of links disappearing)
- Reputation protection (B2B audience values trust)
